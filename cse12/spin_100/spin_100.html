Program Description:

  Spin100Controller.java:
    This program creates all the buttons, text, the canvas, an instance of the
  wheels, the arrows, and the functionality that makes the buttons work and
  not work depending on what is happening. It also says who wins (or if its a
  tie) at the end. In the beginning of running the program, all the buttons
  and their listeners are created. This means that the buttons can be clicked
  and a message can be sent to the actionPerformed method that will carry out
  whatever the button is meant to do. The text that displays at the end of the
  game will be created in the beginning, but hidden for now. When the spin
  buttons are pressed the respective wheel will start to spin. When the wheel
  stops spinning, the score the red arrow stops on will be recorded and added
  to the total score for the player. If the score for the player is equal to
  or over 100, the players buttons will grey out and the other player will
  have the option to play. When that person score is equal to or over 100, the
  buttons will grey out and the winner (or tie) message will be shown. The
  user can finish his turn only if he has spun the wheel at least once. The
  buttons will not work if the the wheel is still spinning. The restart button
  can be pressed at any time as long as the wheels are not spinning. When the
  restart button is pressed, the wheel will go back to its starting location.
  Whoever has the highest score in the end will win. If both players have the
  same score or both have a score above 100, then the program will display
  that it is a tie.


  Spin100Wheel.java:
    This program describes what makes up a Spin100Wheel object; it also
  defines and spins the wheel as defined in the PA write up, and it returns
  the score to the controller. Each spin wheel contains the 20 images that
  make up the wheel, the location of the top image, and other things that make
  the program work as specified. When the spin wheel button is pressed, a
  random unique number of ticks the wheel must go through will be generated.
  The images will change that number of times and stop. When the wheel stops
  spinning a message will be sent to the Spin100Controller.java file and it
  will do the proper things with the score.


  Spin100ControllerEC.java:
    Same as Spin100Controller.java but now the user can choose which direction
  the wheel will spin. Also if the user presses the Switch button, the game
  will reset and the other player will have a chance to go first. This program
  will also keep track of how many times each player has won. 


  Spin100WheelEC.java:
    Same as Spin100Wheel.java but now, depending on which way the user wants
  to spin the wheel, it will do the appropriate things for this to happen.
