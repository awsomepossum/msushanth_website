Program Description:
  
  ResizablePizzaSliceController.java:
    This program creates a horizontal and vertical line at the start of the
    program. These lines are automatically centered to intersect in the middle 
    of canvas. If the user presses down on either of the lines a true/false 
    variable in the program will change to be true. If both the variables are 
    true, this means that the user clicked on both lines in the intersection 
    point. If the user pressed down on the horizontal line, then that true/false 
    variable will turn true (same for the vertical line). The program uses 
    statements thatcheck which lines were clicked (or both) and then moves them 
    around if the user pressed down and dragged the lines around. When the user 
    changes the size of the canvas the lines stay in proportion to their location
    . This is done by dividing the lines x position (for the vertical line) and 
    the y position (for the horizontal line) by the canvas width (for the 
    vertical line) and the canvas height (for the horizontal line). This 
    division creates a proportion to where the lines are on the canvas. For 
    example the horizontal line can be 1/2 of the way down on the canvas and the 
    vertical line can be 1/4th of the way to the right of the canvas. To keep 
    the lines in the same location we then multiply this proportion to the new 
    canvas height (for the horizontal line) and the new canvas width (for the 
    vertical line) so that the horizontal line will always be 1/2 of the way 
    down the canvas and the vertical line will always be 1/4th of the way to the 
    right of the canvas when resizing the canvas. If the user clicks down 
    somewhere on the canvas with no movement, a pizza slice is created. The 
    pizza slice does not get created if the user clicks down with no movement on 
    the lines or outside the canvas. The pizza slice also does not get created 
    if the user presses down, moves the mouse pointer, then releases the mouse.
    This program also creates the three buttons (start, stop, clear all) on the
    top, and also the slider on the bottom of the canvas. The pizza slices are
    pregrammed so that each of them responds separately to the buttons, but all
    at once in the end. For example, when the user presses down on the stop
    button, all the pizza slices will stop, but each of them will stop separately
    from each other. 
  
  
  
  ResizablePizzaSlice.java:
    This program defines what a pizza slice is and what it does. It changes the
    way the pizza slice is facing depending on what quadrant it is in and also
    changes what color the pizza slice is depending on what quadrant it is in. It
    also makes it so the tip of the pizza slice, no matter what quadrant it is 
    in, is always created on where the mouse was clicked. This program also 
    created the animation that makes the pizza slice get bigger and smaller. If 
    the pizza slice is smaller than double its starting size, it will continue 
    growing until it reaches this point. Once it reaches this point it will 
    start shrinking ultil it reaches half its starting size. Once this happens 
    it will grow again, then skrink, then grow... until the program is closed. 
    The growing and shrinking animation is created through a loop that makes the 
    pizza slice smaller and bigger by 5 pixels at a time every 33 milliseconds 
    to create a smooth 30 frames per second animation. If the horizontal or 
    vertical lines are moved, then this programs checks the location of the tip 
    of the pizza slices and then changes their color depending on what quadrant 
    they are in. The animation can be made faster and slower by dragging around 
    the slider. The slider changes the pause time. The user can also stop the 
    animation by pressing the stop button, start the animation by pressing the 
    start button, and clear all the pizza slices by pressing the clear all button.
  
  
  ResizablePizzaSliceControlleraEC.java:
    This program does the same thing except there is now a switch spin button 
    that can change the direction the pizza slice will spin.
