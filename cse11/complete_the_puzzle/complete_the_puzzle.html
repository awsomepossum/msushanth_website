Program Description:

  Puzzle.java:
    This program handles all the mouse events that moves around the puzzle 
  pieces and checks if the puzzle piece was inserted in the correct place,
  creates the unique puzzle pieces to be displayed on the canvas each with
  their own ID and random location, creates the board pieces in order]
  with the same ID as the puzzle pieces, and creates the You Win text at the
  end if the user has completed the puzzle correctly. Arrays, which are data
  structures that hold values, are used in this program to hold images,
  values, ID's, and true and false values that make the program run properly.
  The user can move around the puzzle pieces, but cannot move the center of 
  the piece outside of the canvas since there is a if statement to prevent
  this from happening. In the beginning each puzzle image is assigned a unique
  ID at random. Each puzzle piece is assigned to a random location through the
  use of a random int generator. The integer runs through a formula that
  places it in its proper random location. The board pieces run though a
  different formula that place them in order, but hidden on the board. If the
  puzzle piece is placed above the correct place on the board, and its center
  is within the center 50x50 pixels of the board piece it is over, and its ID
  matches with the ID of the board piece, then the puzzle piece is considered
  to be placed in the correct location. The random int generator, in the
  beginning, assigns the save unique ID to a puzzle piece and its 
  corresponding board piece. If the puzzle piece is placed in the correct
  location, the puzzle piece is hidden, the board piece is shown, and a green
  highlight shows up around the image indicating that the image has been
  placed in the correct location. Once this happens, an index in an array
  will turn from a false value to a true value. This array is keeping track
  of whether all the images are placed in the correct location or not. Once
  all the values in this array turn to true, meaning all the puzzle pieces
  have been placed in the correct location, the highlights surrounding all
  the board pieces will disappear and the user can drag around the completed
  puzzle if they want to. If the user wants to solve the puzzle again, they can
  click down on the mouse pointer without any movement over the completed
  puzzle in order to restart and set everything to how it was when the program
  started.


  PuzzlePiece.java
    This program defines what a puzzle piece is made up of (an image, an id,
  a starting location, and a frame). This program also has methods that the 
  Puzzle program can call to manipulate this puzzle piece. It defines the
  movements, hiding and showing the image, the ID, a check to see if the ID's
  match, the location of the center of the piece, and whether the mouse is
  pressed down on the piece or not.


  BoardPiece.java
    This program defines what a board piece is made up of (an image, an id,
  a starting location, and a frame). This program also has methods that the 
  Puzzle program can call to manipulate this board piece. It defines the
  movements, hiding and showing the image, the ID, a check to see if the ID's
  match, the location of the center of the piece, and whether the mouse is
  pressed down on the piece or not, and the highlights that appear once a 
  puzzle piece is placed in the correct location. 


  Piece.java
    This program outlines what methods are to be used for classes that would
  implement Piece. BoardPiece and PuzzlePiece both implement piece so they
  would need to have all the methods defined in this program to run the
  program. Piece interface outline 6 different methods for classes that 
  implement Piece must use; Piece also extends Highlightable and Hideable, 
  so it also extends those method descriptions as well. 


  Hideable.java
    This program outlines what methods are to be used for classes that would
  implement hideable. (Piece and thus BoardPiece and PuzzlePiece)


  Highlightable.java
    This program outlines what methods are to be used for classes that would
  implement highlightable. (Piece and thus BoardPiece and PuzzlePiece)
